In `app.py`, you’ll find the start of a Flask web application. The application has one route (`/`) that accepts both `POST` requests (after the `if`) and `GET` requests (after the `else`). Currently, when the `/` route is requested via `GET`, the `index.html` template is rendered. When the `/` route is requested via `POST`, the user is redirected back to `/` via `GET`.

`birthdays.db` is a SQLite database with one table, `birthdays`, that has four columns: `id`, `name`, `month`, and `day`. There are a few rows already in this table, though ultimately your web application will support the ability to insert rows into this table!

In the `static` directory is a `styles.css` file containing the CSS code for this web application. No need to edit this file, though you’re welcome to if you’d like!

In the `templates` directory is an `index.html` file that will be rendered when the user views your web application.
