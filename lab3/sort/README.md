# Sort
Recall from lecture that we saw a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.
- Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
- Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
- Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!). Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file.
