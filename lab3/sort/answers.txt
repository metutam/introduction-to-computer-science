sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The running time of selection sort is Ω(n^2), while the running time of bubble sort is Ω(n). Therefore, the running time of bubble sort must be shorter for sorted numbers.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The running time of selection sort and bubble sort is O(n^2), while the running time of merge sort is O(n*logn). Therefore, the running time of merge sort must be shorter for randomly sorted numbers.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: There is only selection sort left.
