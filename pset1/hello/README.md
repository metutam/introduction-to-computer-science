# Hello
Write your first program by typing precisely these lines into hello.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

Suffice it to say, no matter how you compile or execute this program, it only ever prints hello, world. Let’s personalize it a bit, just as we did in class.

Modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their actual name.
